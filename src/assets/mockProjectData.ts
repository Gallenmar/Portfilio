Abiem spēlētājiem ir 0 punktu. Turklāt spēlē tiek izmantota spēles banka, kura sākotnēji ir vienāda ar 0. Spēlētāji veic gājienus pēc kārtas, reizinot pašreizējā brīdī esošu skaitli ar 2, 3 vai 4. Ja reizināšanas rezultātā tiek iegūts pāra skaitlis, tad no spēlētāja punktu skaita tiek atņemts 1 punkts, bet ja nepāra skaitlis – tad 1 punkts tiek pieskaitīts. Savukārt, ja tiek iegūts skaitlis, kas beidzas ar 0 vai 5, tad spēles bankai tiek pieskaitīts 1 punkts. Spēle beidzas, kad ir iegūts skaitlis, kas ir lielāks par vai vienāds ar 5000. Spēlētājs, pēc kura gājiena spēle beidzas, iztukšo banku, saviem punktiem pieskaitot bankas punktus. Uzvar spēlētājs, kam ir vairāk punktu spēles beigās. Ja punktu skaits ir vienāds, tad rezultāts ir neizšķirts.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca91cf1-0ddc-4dd3-9df4-e5f0437c567e)\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea7cf2bc-137e-4f20-8a89-50583fc136b3)\n",

These tests are designed to validate various functionalities of the website, such as registration, search, sorting, adding products to the cart as well as negative tests.\n\n## Test Cases\n### Basic Page Load Test (testBasic)\nValidates the basic page load functionality by checking if the URL matches the expected URL of the Pet Store homepage.\n\n### Registration and Redirect Test (testRegisteringAndRedirectToHome)\nTests the registration process by registering a new user with a unique email address and verifies if the user is redirected to the homepage after registration.\n\n### User Information Verification Test (testCorrectInfoAfterRegister)\nVerifies that the user information displayed after registration matches the expected information provided during registration.\n\n### Sorting Test (testSort)\nTests the sorting functionality by sorting products by price in ascending and descending order and verifies if the sorting is done correctly.\n\n### Search Test (testSearch)\nTests the search functionality by entering a search query, navigating to the search results page, and verifying if the expected product is displayed in the search results.\n\n### Cart Functionality Test (testCart)\nTests the cart functionality by adding two products to the cart and verifies if both products are added successfully and the cart count is correct.\n\n### Not enough information Negative Test (testNotAllFieldsFilled)\nTests the error handling by attempting to register without filling in all required fields and verifies if the expected error message is displayed.\n\n### Not unique email Negative Test (testNotUniqueEmail)\nTests the error handling when attempting to register with an email that has already been registered.\n\n## File Structure\nAll the tests are in the src/test/java/MyTests directory. The main tests are in PSTestNGlog.java file in Mytests package. The LogUtility class is created for logging test procedure in Logs directory.\n\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3f56e4-e6ef-4162-93d1-e8584aecd7da)\n\n## License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n\n",

The clock consists of a circle with tick marks around the circumference, a minute hand, an hour hand, and a second hand. The program uses a **2D transformation algorithm** to continuously update the position of the clock hands as they rotate around the center of the clock. \n\nOne can adjust the speed of the clock by using arrow keys or the number row. Additionaly this program can change color themes.\n",
